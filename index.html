        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
        <code
          >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
          scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
          assumed to represent a variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
          variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>
        <code
          >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
          WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
          //statements }</code
        >
        <p>
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
        </p>
        <code
          >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
            curly brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named
          square:
        </p>
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; } </code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number; </code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
          changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
          globally or in the calling function.
